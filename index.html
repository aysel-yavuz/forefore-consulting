                  <h1>Case Study</h1>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Global Financial company needed to find a PDF viewer with
                      redacting capabilities. They were about o purchase one
                      based on nothing more than influence from advertising.
                      However, one of our advisors performed an thorough
                      research, lisiting all products in the market and taking
                      notes of all of their resources, including prices,
                      documention, and features that the company would need in a
                      near future... and the solution was different from the one
                      that the company initially considered. The company was
                      able to get ahead of the competitors with a solution that
                      was (surprisingly) a perfect fit for their industry and
                      also reduce costs by not needing to acquire new products
                      for the following projects that came down the line.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A fin-tech company needed to create a robust, lean and
                      performant UI Component Library but wasn't sure on how to
                      make it on a way that could cater to their multiple lines
                      of business. One of our advisors, very experienced on
                      that, successfully guided the creation of their
                      development enviroment and workflow, putting in place the
                      needed structure for testing and self-auto-documentation,
                      leading to a code that has been easy to maintain and
                      extend. It revolutionized the company design system,
                      making it possible to stablish a strong visual identity
                      across all lines of businesses and reducing development
                      time in around 30%.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      One of our advisors was able to create three plans on how
                      to implement the concept of a "Smart Broom" to be used on
                      the cleaning of a restaurant chain. It was a huge success,
                      because besides being easy to implement it was also low
                      cost, proving that not all inovation require high
                      investments.

                      <p>
                        The price might change depending on the advisor that
                        gets selected to your project. Also, if your project
                        requires a multi-disciplinary group, having multiple
                        advisor would increase the investment necessary.
                        However, the Forefront's Core-Team is highly experienced
                        and usually performe a lot of the basic leg-work, so
                        that when the Professors and lead experts arrive, their
                        time can be better used, and consequently lowering the
                        costs.

                      <h2>Do I get to choose the advisors?</h2>
                      <p>
                        We do our best to make that happen. However, some of our
                        advisors cannot assist certain industries because of
                        their non-compete clauses with their main employers.
                        Also, it could happen that the advisor already is
                        completely booked with other projects. However, our
                        large network of contacts within the Academia and the
                        industry, allow us to have many professionals that are
                        some of the best in their field.

                      <p>
                        Yes you can. However, the prices go significantly down
                        the more hours you purchase.

                      <p>
                        No. We understand the privacy is important and that
                        sometimes you just want a personal consultation with our
                        experts. Therefore, you can rest assured that our

                        No. That is up to you, of course. Some people prefer to
                        create hypotetical cases, generalizing the actual issue
                        their companies are facing, so that we do not need to
                        officially involve their employers.
