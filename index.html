                      <span class="strong">A global financial company</span>
                      needed to find a browser-based PDF viewer with smart
                      redacting capabilities. They were about o purchase one
                      based on nothing more than influence from advertising.
                      However, one of our advisors performed an thorough
                      research, lisiting all products in the market and taking
                      notes of all of their features, their prices, and giving
                      score for the quality of other aspects such as
                      documention, customer support, community size,
                      compatibility with the company's techstack, and dozens of
                      other criteria. This report was used to evaluate the
                      potential of each solution to satisfy not only the current
                      project, but also future projects. Finally, the report
                      also described what it would take to create an in-house
                      solution and the steps to make that happen. The leadersgip
                      of the company loved the report and was able to make an
                      educated choice, choosing the most optimal solution,
                      balancing scope, quality, price, and development speed,
                      which saved thousands of dollars for that project and many
                      consecutive projects since then.

                      needed to create a robust, lean and performant UI
                      Component Library but wasn't sure on how to make it that
                      way while still supporting multiple lines of business
                      (LOB). Each LOB could potentally require different (a)
                      features, (b) release and maintenance schedule, (c) theme,
                      (d) types of web developers, (e) timezones and languages
                      to support, etc. How could we make it so versitile and yet
                      keep it lean and easy to use? One of Forefront's advisors,
                      successfully designed the solution, created the
                      dev-enviroment, coded the first few components as
                      examples, trained the team, stablished a custom workflow,
                      and invented an self-documentation solution that
                      automatically creates a portal website, favoring
                      discoverability. The initiative was so successful that it
                      grew into a Frontend Shop. It also revolutionized the
                      company's Design System, making it possible to stablish a
                      strong visual identity across all lines of businesses and
                      reducing development time in around 30%. The UI Library
                      also enabled that high-fideliy prototypes could be created
                      in just few days, briging a tremendous business advantage
                      for the organization.

                      looking for an innovative method of cleaning which would
                      guarantee their insurance provider that they were
                      eliminating their number one cause of claims: slip-n-fall.
                      <br />
                      One of our advisors created three models of "smart mops"
                      and "smart brooms" which would connect to the local
                      manager's computer, letting them know the frequency and
                      the areas the areas covered with cleaning during the work
                      hours. The idea was the the grounds should be cleaned even
                      if no visible spills were found, because they could go
                      unnoticed and lead to accidents. With the use of those
                      smart devices, besides saving money with their insurance
                      premiums, the restaurant chain also reduced the number of
                      accidents.

                        by the number of consulting hours purchased. The more
                        hours purchased, the lower the cost per hour.
