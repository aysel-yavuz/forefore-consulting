                                from their advices as you start a new project or try to overcome an existing obstacle.

                                    <li>Global Financial company needed to find a PDF viewer with redacting capabilities. They were about o purchase one based on nothing more than influence from advertising. However, one of our advisors performed an thorough research, lisiting all products in the market and taking notes of all of their resources, including prices, documention, and features that the company would need in a near future... and the solution was different from the one that the company initially considered. The company was able to get ahead of the competitors with a solution that was (surprisingly) a perfect fit for their industry and also reduce costs by not needing to acquire new products for the following projects that came down the line.</li>
                                    <li>A fin-tech company needed to create a robust, lean and performant UI Component Library but wasn't sure on how to make it on a way that could cater to their multiple lines of business. One of our advisors, very experienced on that, successfully guided the creation of their development enviroment and workflow, putting in place the needed structure for testing and self-auto-documentation, leading to a code that has been easy to maintain and extend. It revolutionized the company design system, making it possible to stablish a strong visual identity across all lines of businesses and reducing development time in around 30%.</li>
                                    <li>One of our advisors was able to create three plans on how to implement the concept of a "Smart Broom" to be used on the cleaning of a restaurant chain. It was a huge success, because besides being easy to implement it was also low cost, proving that not all inovation require high investments.</li>

                                            having multiple advisor would increase the investment necessary. However,

                                            We do our best to make that happen. However, some of our advisors
                                            cannot assist certain industries because of their non-compete clauses with
                                            their main employers. Also, it could happen that the advisor already is

                                            No. We understand the privacy is important and that sometimes you just want a personal
                                            consultation with our experts. Therefore, you can rest assured that our communication
                                            will remain private.

                                            No. That is up to you, of course. Some people prefer to create hypotetical cases,
                                            generalizing the actual issue their companies are facing, so that we do not need
                                            to officially involve their employers.
