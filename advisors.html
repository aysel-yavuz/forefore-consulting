                <br>&nbsp;<h3 class="strong">No contract</h3>
                There is not employment link, no contract, and no commitment. If you are approved, we would simply add your name to our list of carefullt selected advisors.
                <br>&nbsp;<h3 class="strong">Choose your projects</h3>
                Professors are free to evaluate the opportunities that come up and decide which ones to join. There is no commitment until you accept to join the project.
                <br>&nbsp;<h3 class="strong">Diversity - Exposure to different industries</h3>
                Professors often get stuck withing one or two industry segments. With Forefront, you will get exposed to a much wider range of challenges from different industries.
                <br>&nbsp;<h3 class="strong">Limited Liability</h3>
                With Forefront, you incur on less liability since you will be working through an LLC and not as an individual. Also we will take care of all the legal documentation related to the work.
                <br>&nbsp;<h3 class="strong">Marketing and Adverstising</h3>
                Professors don’t need to spend time or money going after opportunities
                <br>&nbsp;<h3 class="strong">Less secretary-type work</h3>
                Forefront will take care of answering customers’ basic questions, dealing with billing, provide reports/receipts, english grammar review, etc
                <br>&nbsp;<h3 class="strong">Payroll</h3>
                Professors will receive official 1099 Forms, paystubs, and other important documents
                <br>&nbsp;<h3 class="strong">Record keeping</h3>
                Professors will not be bothered if a customer shows up a year later to ask for a document
                <br>&nbsp;<h3 class="strong">Make it easy for the professor to drop out from the project if needed</h3>
                If something changes for the professor (like a NSF grant getting approved), Forefront can assist on finding a replacement so that the professor can move on
                <br>&nbsp;<h3 class="strong">Leg work</h3>
                Some project that might need some basic leg work, such as research, coding, or experimentation, Forefront can provide qualified workforce to assist the professors with the most mundane and repetitive tasks

                      based on nothing more than influence from advertising.
                      However, one of our advisors performed an thorough
                      research, lisiting all products in the market and taking
                      notes of all of their features, their prices, and giving
                      score for the quality of other aspects such as
                      documention, customer support, community size,
                      compatibility with the company's techstack, and dozens of
                      other criteria. This report was used to evaluate the
                      potential of each solution to satisfy not only the current
                      project, but also future projects. Finally, the report
                      also described what it would take to create an in-house
                      solution and the steps to make that happen. The leadersgip
                      of the company loved the report and was able to make an
                      educated choice, choosing the most optimal solution,
                      balancing scope, quality, price, and development speed,
                      which saved thousands of dollars for that project and many
                      consecutive projects since then.

                      way while still supporting multiple lines of business
                      (LOB). Each LOB could potentally require different (a)
                      features, (b) release and maintenance schedule, (c) theme,
                      (d) types of web developers, (e) timezones and languages
                      to support, etc. How could we make it so versitile and yet
                      keep it lean and easy to use? One of Forefront's advisors,
                      successfully designed the solution, created the
                      dev-enviroment, coded the first few components as
                      examples, trained the team, stablished a custom workflow,
                      and invented an self-documentation solution that
                      automatically creates a portal website, favoring
                      discoverability. The initiative was so successful that it
                      grew into a Frontend Shop. It also revolutionized the
                      company's Design System, making it possible to stablish a
                      strong visual identity across all lines of businesses and
                      reducing development time in around 30%. The UI Library
                      also enabled that high-fideliy prototypes could be created
                      in just few days, briging a tremendous business advantage
                      for the organization.

                      <span class="strong">A global restaurant chain</span> was
                      looking for an innovative method of cleaning which would
                      guarantee their insurance provider that they were
                      eliminating their number one cause of claims: slip-n-fall.
                      <br />
                      One of our advisors created three models of "smart mops"
                      and "smart brooms" which would connect to the local
                      manager's computer, letting them know the frequency and
                      the areas the areas covered with cleaning during the work
                      hours. The idea was the the grounds should be cleaned even
                      if no visible spills were found, because they could go
                      unnoticed and lead to accidents. With the use of those
                      smart devices, besides saving money with their insurance
                      premiums, the restaurant chain also reduced the number of
                      accidents.

                        The price is dependent on the particular advisor or
                        advisors selected for your project. It is also affected
                        by the number of consulting hours purchased. The more
                        hours purchased, the lower the cost per hour.

                        We do our best to make that happen. However, some of our
                        advisors cannot assist certain industries because of
                        their non-compete clauses with their main employers or
                        they could simply be booked with other projects. Please
                        rest assured that our large network of professionals
                        within Academia and industry ensures we will find the

                        It is up to you. Some high executives reach out to us to
                        get access to bright minds in order to bounce ideas
                        with, mature their thoughts, and elevate the level of
                        their contributions on up coming meetings. Their
                        employers are not involved. However, other people reach
                        out to us because they want to get us involved with
                        their teams. You decide. We are here to serve.

                        No. That is up to you, of course. Some people prefer to
                        create hypotetical cases, generalizing the actual issue
                        their companies are facing, so that we do not need to
                        officially involve their employers. Either way, you have
